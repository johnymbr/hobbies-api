# Repository for hobbies-api

### This project is a little practice for learning how to works with Node.

I did use Node with Typescript, Express, MongoDB and Jest for the tests.

To run project, follow the steps below:
 1. Clone this repository;
 2. Inside the created folder, run ```npm install```;
 3. Run ```npm run dev```.

After these steps, the server will be running on http://localhost:3000.
It's possible to access the documentation through the link http://localhost:3000/api/documentation.

**P.S.:**
I included the Jest library for the tests, but i didn't succeed to execute this correctly.
