Repository for hobbies-api

This project is a little practice for learning how to works with Node.

I did use Node with Typescript, Express, MongoDB and Jest for the tests.

To run project, follow the step above:
 - Clone this repository;
 - Inside the created folder, run npm install;
 - Run npm run dev

After these steps, the server will be running on localhost:3000.
It's possible to access the documentation through the link http://localhost:3000/api/documentation.

P.S.:
I included the Jest library for the tests, but i didn't succeed to execute correctly.
